OBJECTIVES: 

1. To design an alert system that provide the real-time information about the incidence to the authorities, which helps in fast rescue of the child.
2. To develop a voice-assisted monitoring system capable of live streaming incidents and monitoring the environmental conditions at a borewell, facilitating effective child rescue operations.

RESULTS:

The proposed system was tested in a controlled environment and performed effectively. 
The sensors accurately detected gas levels, temperature, and humidity, providing real-time environmental data. 
The live video stream offered clear visuals, helping rescuers monitor conditions inside the borewell, while the voice assistance feature allowed communication with the trapped child. By delivering crucial real-time insights, the system improved situational awareness and decision-making, making rescue efforts faster, safer, and more effective. These results highlight its potential to significantly enhance borewell rescue operations and save lives.
